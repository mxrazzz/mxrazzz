### 🚀 About Me

I'm Meraz — a curious mind passionate about using **tech to solve real-world problems**.  
Right now, I'm diving deep into **data engineering**, **AI tools**, and how they power **smart decisions in business**.  

I've worn a few hats already:
- 📈 BI & Python Dev intern
- 🎓 Bootcamp grad (Le Wagon 💻)
- 🎯 Future-focused learner

I also tutor on the side — helping students build confidence in Maths & English, especially those new to the UK. This taught me patience, empathy, and how to **explain complex things simply** — a skill I carry into everything I do.
